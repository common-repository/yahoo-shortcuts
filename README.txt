== Description ==

Enhance you blog posts with the Yahoo! Shortcuts powered plugin.  This plugin provides three key benefits:

Convenience:  As you write your blog post the plugin finds places, companies, products, Flickr photos, people, and much more that are relevant for you blog post.  It then brings you relevant content (a map for a point of interest or a finance quote for a company) for the things it found in your post.  

Control: You can then decide to keep or remove the recommended content so that you remain in control of what appears on your blog.  

Experience: The plugin provides a simple way to enrich your blog post with great content (Maps, Finance quotes, Flickr photos, etc.) so that your posts are engaging & elegant for your readers.
